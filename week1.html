            <h2 class="title-section"> Downloading Git</h2>    
            <p> Firstly, engineer Hashim gave us a brief description about the diploma.He also explained how time management is a key element to succeed in this program. Secondly, we have downloaded Git that we will use to store our files at different versions. I face some problems in downloading this software since I have a MacBook and Git is not installed directly , another software is required in order to have Git . This program require 8 GB and my disk storage was almost full, so I had to free some space and that took some time.finally, we have create it an account in <a href="https://github.com">
              github </a> that we will work on next week. Here are the steps to download Git in MacBook using <a href="https://brew.sh">Hombrew</a>:-</p>
          <p> 1-open the terminal using the spotlight search and copy the highlited command</p>
          <pre>       </pre>
          <img src="assets/img/step1.png" width="500" height="200" class="center">
          <pre>     </pre>
          <p> 2-once the installation is complete download Git using the following command</p>
          <pre>     </pre>
    
          <img src="assets/img/step2.png" width="500" height="200" class="center">
              
          <pre>       </pre>
          <p> 3-To check if git installed correctly copy this command : git--version and it should return the version of git</p>
          <pre>            </pre>
          <h2 class="title-section"> Creating website using HTML syntax</h2>
          <p> Thirdly, we learned how to write code in HTML5 syntax. HTML is launguage used to structure the content of web browser.That's will help us to create our own website and document all our work throught the diploma. We learned the basic things like writing paragraph, headers , add images and hyperlinks all by the help of <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">w3schools</a> tutorials.After that we have installed <a href=https://brackets.io>Brackets</a> to edit on HTML files. we used a free website template index file to make changes on it and see the alteration in Live preview.</p>
          <pre>     </pre>
         
           <h2 class="title-section"> My own website</h2>
          <p>I created this website by altering a free template from <a href="https://themefisher.com">THEMEFISHER</a>.The downloaded template has a main folder that contain  HTML files for the contant of the website and CSS files for the style of the website. After that, I open the brackets program and access the index file. The indix file contains the whole website's HTML syntax. I prefer to work in live preview mode so that I can see the changes as they happen in the browser. In addition to that , when you choose a line of code, it highlights the element that refers to it.</p> 
          <img src="assets/img/live.png" width="500" height="200" class="center" >
          <pre>        </pre>
          <p>The code is written in chronological order, beginning with the website's title and progressing to the bottom of the page. First, I modify the website's title to my name. This may be accomplished by modifying the sentence in the title tag as shown below. </p>
          <img src="assets/img/title.png" width="700" height="50" class="center">
          <pre>       </pre>
           <h3 class="title-section"> <span class="fg-primary">navigation bar</span> </h3>
         
          <p>Following that, I changed the navigation bar and added a drop menu to one of the elements. There are currently three pages on the website: home, about, and assignments. The bar's code is displayed below:-</p>
          <img src="assets/img/nav-code.png" width="500" height="200" class="center">
          <pre>                 </pre>
          <p> The name of each item in the "a" tag was changed. When we click on each item, we are taken to a new page, which is accomplished through the use of the href command. The name of the html file is written inside the quotation marks in this command and should be stored in the main file. The dropdown menu HTML and CSS code for the assignment element is obtained from <a href="https://demo.themefisher.com/airspace/">airspace </a>index file. When you click on each item in the menu, you will be taken to a specific page using the href command, as previously described. Here's a snapshot of the navigation bar before and after the adjustment.</p>
          <h3 class="title-section"> <span class="fg-primary">before alteration</span> </h3>
          <img src="assets/img/nav-before.png" width="700" height="50" class="center">
          <pre>          </pre>
          <h3 class="title-section"> <span class="fg-primary">after alteration</span> </h3>
          <img src="assets/img/nav-after.png" width="700" height="50" class="center">
          <pre>               </pre>
           <h3 class="title-section"> <span class="fg-primary">Home page</span> </h3>
          
         <p> The home page is the initial page of the website and contains an index.html file. There are just photos as banner backgrounds on this page. In The img tag I modifies the picture. There should be a source(src) element in this tag that contains the name of the file where the picture is saved, the name of the image, and the kind of image. Here's an example of an image code:-</p>
          <img src="assets/img/home%20image.png" width="3000" height="50" class="center">
          <pre>          </pre>
           <h3 class="title-section"> <span class="fg-primary">about page</span> </h3>
          
          <p>When users click on the about item in the navigation bar, we are sent to the about page, which includes an html file named about. This page has a banner, photographs, and a brief biography of myself. Two photos were included as linked images for contact. The code for the mail icon is displayed below. To connect from one page to another, the a tag should be used. The attribute href is then used to add the link, which will redirect to the email. Finally, the picture is placed using the img tag, as previously mentioned, with extra attributes specifying the image's width and height. </p>
          
          <img src="assets/img/m-icon.png" width="3000" height="50" class="center">
          <pre>  </pre>
          
            <h3 class="title-section"> <span class="fg-primary">Assignment page</span> </h3>
          
          <p>The last element in navigation bar is assignment item.It has dropdown menu , currently with two contents.This will be used for the documenting evrything done each week through the diploma.when clicking on one content it directed to the specific week page.The paragraphs are written through the p tag.The images are inserted through img tag .The image is placed in the centre using by adding code in CSS from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">w3schools</a>  and the class name should be add to img tag.finally, the pre tag is used for space between paragraphs and images</p>
